"""
Harmonize job task (Sprint 4).

The single source of truth for *running* a harmonization, shared by both the
arq worker (``queue`` mode) and the inline executor (``inline`` mode). It:

- drives the job_runs lifecycle (queued -> running -> succeeded/failed/cancelled),
- publishes stage-by-stage progress on the Redis bus (so every connected user
  sees live updates regardless of which process runs the work),
- checks the cancel flag at each stage boundary,
- runs the CPU-heavy engine pipeline in a worker thread so the API event loop
  stays responsive for other concurrent users.

    ``mode`` selects which mappers run:

    - ``"both"``      : schema mapping then value→ontology mapping (default).
    - ``"schema"``    : SchemaMapper only — column→field, no ontology pass.
    - ``"ontology"``  : OntologyMapper only — return just the value→ontology

                        resolve each column's curated field, because the
                        ontology vocabularies are keyed by curated field (e.g.
                        ``sex``, ``body_site``) — not by the raw column name.
                        Without that resolution a column like ``gender`` would
                        never route to the ``sex`` value dictionary, so the
                        ontology output would silently differ from ``both``.
                        The internal schema mappings are not persisted.

    ``ontology_columns`` scopes the ontology pass (in both ``"both"`` and
    ``"ontology"`` modes): when provided, only those columns are value-mapped.
    Leave it empty to resolve every column.
