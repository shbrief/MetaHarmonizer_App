"""Engine output-column contract test (F-11 safeguard).

The dashboard depends on the upstream ``metaharmonizer`` package emitting a
stable set of *output columns* from its schema-mapping call. We promised the
engine team that any rename here is a breaking change they tag, and that our
adapter absorbs it in ONE place (``metaharmonizer_impl._to_dashboard_row``).

That promise is only real if a rename fails loudly instead of silently
returning empty mappings. These tests are that tripwire:

1. ``test_dashboard_row_reads_contract_columns`` pins the exact upstream column
   names the adapter reads, using a synthetic row. Runs anywhere pandas is
   importable; no engine, no network.
2. ``test_engine_schema_output_has_contract_columns`` runs the *real* engine on
   a tiny CSV and asserts the output frame still carries the contract columns.
   Skips where the heavy ``metaharmonizer`` package isn't installed (the
   lightweight test venv); runs in the full engine env / CI-with-engine.
